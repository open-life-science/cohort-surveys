## Do you think your mentee was able to effectively engage with OLS throughout the program? *
_We're asking this to get an idea of numbers since we noted a little drop-off in OLS-4. We're not 100% sure why but thought it might be due to pandemic-related fatigue, burnout, or illness, so we're exploring what options we can offer. Any info you can provide would be handy - we're also considering offering people the chance to return in OLS-5 if we have enough spots free._
- [ ] Yes, they were able to engage
- [ ] No, they had difficulty engaging or attending calls
- [ ] Other:

## Anything else you would like to share with us? (we have also created an anonymous survey: [LINK REDACTED] and encourage you to share any feedback, reflections and incident from the OLS-4 program that the OLS team should know.)
